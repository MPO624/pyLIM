class LIM(object):
    """Linear inverse forecast model.
    
    This class uses a calibration dataset to make simple linear forecasts. 
    Can perform forecasts using random or contiguous resampling, or with
    separate calibration and forecast datasets.
    
    Notes
    -----
    It's based on the LIM described by M. Newman (2013) [1].  Right now it
    assumes the use of monthly data (i.e. each timestep should represent a
    single month).

        Parameters
        ----------
        calibration: ndarray
            Dataset for determining LIM forecast EOFs.  Provided data should be
            in a 2D MxN matrix where M (rows) represent temporal samples and
            N(columns) represent spatial samples. Data should be in spatial
            anomaly format.
        fcast_times: array_like
            1D array-like object containing all times to forecast at with the
            LIM.
        H5file: HDF5_Object
            File object to store LIM output.  It will create a series of 
            directories under the given group
